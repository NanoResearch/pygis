Python GIS Experiments
======================

This is a collection of some Python experiments I've been writing for
interoperating with GIS systems and file formats.

Currently the only useful tool is ``shp2kml`` which can convert ArcGIS-style
SHP and DBF files into KML files for visualising with Google Earth or any
number of online mapping providers.
